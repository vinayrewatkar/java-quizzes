JSP Lifecycle Methods
=========================
What is JSP (JavaServer Pages)?
---------------------------------
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology used to create dynamic, platform-independent web content. It's a part of Java EE (Jakarta EE) and allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages using special JSP tags.

Why Do We Need JSP?
---------------------------------
We need JSP because it helps solve a key problem in web development:
Mixing dynamic content generation with HTML presentation in a clean and maintainable way.


Method	Purpose
 jspInit()	Called once when the JSP is initialized; used for setup like DB connections.
_jspService()	Called every time the JSP handles a request; processes client input.
 jspDestroy()	Called once when the JSP is being removed; used for cleanup.

These methods are part of the servlet lifecycle, and in JSP, they map as follows:

jspInit() → like init() in servlets.

_jspService() → handles the request, similar to doGet()/doPost() in servlets.

jspDestroy() → like destroy() in servlets.
